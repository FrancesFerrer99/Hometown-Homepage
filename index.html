                            Villa Olmo is a neoclassical villa.
                            The villa was commissioned by marquis Innocenzo Odescalchi from Swiss architect Simone Cantoni in 1797.
                            As it was designed to be a summer retreat for the aristocracy, it was built alongside the lake.
                            The villa was named after an elm tree planted in the middle of the ornate gardens, which is no longer alive today.

                            The castle occupies the ancient site of Comum Oppidum, the original settlement of Como, dating from the 1st millennium BC.
                            Later it was one of the last Byzantine strongholds in the area, surrendering to the Lombards in 588.
                            The castle was restored during the War of the Lombard League, with the help of emperor Frederick Barbarossa (1158).
                            Barbarossa officially donated it to the citizens of Como in 1178.
